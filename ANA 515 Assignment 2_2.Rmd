#The dataset in use, sourced from FiveThirtyEight, details alcohol consumption by country. It captures the average annual per capita consumption of different types of alcohol across various nations. This dataset aims to provide insights into global alcohol consumption patterns. Research questions it can address include identifying countries with the highest and lowest alcohol consumption and determining the most and least consumed types of alcohol.

#The dataset is stored in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, a flat file format. Delimited by commas, CSV files are easily readable and writable using numerous software programs, including R.

```

```{r drinks, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

drinks <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv"
data <- read_csv(drinks)

#The read_csv function from the readr package is used to read the CSV file.

```

# Inline code to print number of rows and columns
This dataframe has `r nrow(data)` rows and `r ncol(data)` columns. The names of the columns and a brief description of each are in the table below:

```{r Characteristics, echo=TRUE}

                  "Wine servings per person per year",
